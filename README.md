## Lab exercises for Social Network Analysis course in NTUA

### Lab1:
* Construction and visualisation of complex network types
* Network metrics (clustering coeff, mean path, diameter, radius)
* Node centrality metrics (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, Katz centrality, PageRank)
* Connectedness and robustness
* Transition from Regular to Small World and Random Erdos-Renyi topologies
* Real network type recognition

### Lab2:
* Comparison of real networks with synthetic topologies
* Community detection using various techniques (Spectral Clustering, Newman-Girvan, Modularity Maximization)
